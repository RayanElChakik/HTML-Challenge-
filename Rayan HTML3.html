      <p>
        Romance. The island of Bora Bora rises from the velvet blues of the deep water up through the softer hues of the lagoon and into the air that
        surrounds the island. Its touch of the sea breeze tingles the skin. Its power fills each beat of the heart. Bora Bora is located a brief 50-minute
        flight from The Islands of Tahiti or Moorea. Bora Bora, with a lagoon of turquoise waters resembling an artist’s palette of bright blues and greens,
        will make you feel love at first sight. Romantics from around the world appreciate Bora Bora, where the lush tropical slopes and valleys of Mount Otemanu
        blossom with hibiscus, while palm-covered motu circle the illuminated lagoon like a delicate pearl necklace from the islands of French Polynesia.<br>
        The perfect white-sand Bora Bora beaches leading to Matira Point give way to blue waters where tropical-colored fish animate the coral gardens and
         giant manta rays glide leisurely past. This south pacific island could easily be defined as the center of the romantic universe,
         where luxury resorts and spas dot the island with overwater bungalows, thatched-roof villas, and a fabled ambiance. Simply put,
         Bora Bora is one of the most beautiful islands in the world.

    <h1> Location of Bora Bora </h1>
    <p> It is located on a dormant volcano island, set on one of the most beautiful and crystal-clear lagoons in the world, colored in a
      million shades of blue. Known for gorgeous luxury resorts and numerous adventurous activities,
      it is one of the northwestern islands that make up The Islands of Tahiti. The vast motu of Bora Bora’s white-sand beaches lined with coconut
      trees encircle the emerald lagoon that’s populated with myriad fish and multi-colored corals. The tallest point is the breathtaking Mount Otemanu at
      Bora Bora’s center.

    <h1>Explore Bora Bora</h1>
    <p>
      Most of Bora Bora's residents live on the flat coastal strip that rings the island.
      The paved round-island road skirts the shoreline and runs in and out of the bays.
      Because the road is only 32km (19 miles) long, many visitors see it by bicycle (give yourself a full day), scooter, or car.
      Some of the sights mentioned below may not be easy to find, however, so consider taking a guided tour around the island.
