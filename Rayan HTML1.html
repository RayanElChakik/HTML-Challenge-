      <h2><i> Overview about the G-class 2021 </i></h2>
    <p>
    The name of the groundbreaking concept vehicle stands not only for the close collaboration in developing the show car together with the AVATAR team but also for ADVANCED VEHICLE TRANSFORMATION. <br>
    This concept vehicle embodies the vision of Mercedes-Benz designers, engineers and trend researchers for mobility in the distant future.<br>
    <br></p>
    <h2> <em> Extremely confident â€“ and completely without emissions </em></h2>
    <p>
      With its four high-performance and near-wheel-built electric motors, the VISION AVTR embodies a particularly agile implementation of the vision of a dynamic luxury saloon.<br>
       With a combined engine power of more than 350 kW, the VISION AVTR sets a new benchmark for EQ Power. <br>
       Thanks to the intelligent and fully variable torque distribution, the power of the four fully individually controllable motors is not only managed in the best possible way in terms of driving dynamics,
       but above all in a highly efficient manner.

        <h3> <mark> Organic battery technology </mark> </h3>
        <p>
          The VISION AVTR was designed in line with its innovative electric drive.<br>
           This is based on a particularly powerful and compact high-voltage battery. <br>
           For the first time, the revolutionary battery technology is based on graphene-based organic cell chemistry and thus completely eliminates rare, toxic and expensive earths such as metals. <br>
           Electromobility thus becomes independent of fossil resources.<br>
            An absolute revolution is also the recyclability by composting, which is 100% recyclable due to the materiality. <br>
            As a result, Mercedes-Benz underlines the high relevance of a future circular economy in the raw materials sector. <br>
